# Differentials
This customizable R script can be used to perform differential expression analysis from featureCount/htseq count data.
Additionally, a ggpubr package MAPlot script has been added to generate better and high quality plots.
multimir.R is also added to aid in the analysis of annotation of miRNAs.

This repository is curated by Agnik Haldar. These scripts were made during my doctoral studies.
